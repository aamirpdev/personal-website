Hi! I'm a mathematics graduate currently taking an Computer Science MSc, based in London.

My interests lie in technology and technology-adjacent topics including data, cryptocurrency, privacy etc. I also have interests in economics, fitness, health and MMA.

This website is here predominantly to act as a personal wiki of my thoughts and ideas, also to learn hugo.

Books I'm currently reading:

Deep Work by Cal Newport
Digital Gold: Bitcoin and the Inside Story of the Misfits and Millionaires Trying to Reinvent Money by Nathaniel Popper
