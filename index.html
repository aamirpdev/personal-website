    <p>Hi! I'm a mathematics graduate, currently taking an Computer Science MSc at University of Birmingham.</p>
    <p>
      My interests lie in technology and technology-adjacent subjects including startups, privacy, cryptocurrency etc. I
      also have interests in productivity, libertarism, economics, and MMA.
